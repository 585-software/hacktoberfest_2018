## Goals

- Introduction to Open Source
- Introduction to GitHub and Pull Requests
- Get free shirts!

## Open Source

- Developed for everyone to see
- Licensed to include the source code
- Collaborative

## Open Source

- Educational
- Foundation for further innovation
- "None of us is as smart as all of us."

## Licensing

This is what makes your source open.

^I am not a lawyer.

## Choosing a License

- Permissive?
- Do you care about patents?
- Viral?
- Fitting in?

[https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

^Permissive: let anyone do whatever they want with the code.

^Patents: must contributors grant use of patents they hold?

^Viral: should derivative works also be open source?

^Fitting in: what do other projects in this language or domain use?
